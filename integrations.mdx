## Configuring Webhooks

Set up webhooks in AdaptAI to send real-time events to your endpoint.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Webhook" icon="plus">
    In the dashboard, go to **Integrations > Webhooks > New Webhook**. Enter your endpoint URL, e.g., `https://your-webhook-url.com/webhook`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Events" icon="zap">
    Choose events like `query.resolved` or `employee.onboarded`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Signature" icon="shield">
    Use HMAC SHA-256 with your secret to validate payloads.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<ParamField header="X-Webhook-Signature" param-type="string" required="true">
  HMAC signature for payload verification.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="event" param-type="string" required="true">
  Event type, e.g., `query.resolved`.
</ParamField>

<ResponseField name="data" field-type="object">
  Event-specific payload with employee details.
</ResponseField>

<CodeGroup tabs="Node.js,Python">
  ```javascript
  const crypto = require('crypto');
  const signature = 'sha256=' + crypto.createHmac('sha256', 'YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET')
    .update(payload)
    .digest('hex');
  ```
  ```python
  import hmac
  import hashlib
  signature = 'sha256=' + hmac.new(
    b'YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET', payload, hashlib.sha256
  ).hexdigest()
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices for Secure Connections

- Rotate API keys and webhook secrets every 90 days.
- Use least-privilege access: Grant only read permissions for HR syncs.
- Validate all incoming payloads with signatures to prevent replay attacks.
- Monitor webhook delivery rates in AdaptAI analytics.

<Callout kind="alert">
  Never expose secrets in client-side code or public repositories. Use environment variables like `{process.env.API_KEY}`.
</Callout>

<Expandable title="Advanced Webhook Retry Logic" default-open="false">
  AdaptAI retries failed webhooks up to 5 times with exponential backoff. Customize via headers:

  | Header          | Description                  |
  |-----------------|------------------------------|
  | `Retry-After`  | Seconds before next attempt |
  | `X-Retry-Count`| Current retry number        |
